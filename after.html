     <p><h1  style="font-family: sans-serif;"> Thought I almost died in my dream again (baby, almost died)<br>
      Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again<br>
      I'm fallin' in too deep (oh)<br>
      Without you, don't wanna sleep (fallin' in)<br>
      'Cause my heart belongs to you<br>
      I'll risk it all for you<br>
      I want you next to me<br>
      This time, I'll never leave<br>
      I wanna share babies<br>
      Protection, we won't need<br>
      Your body next to me<br>
      Is just a memory<br>
      I'm fallin' in too deep, oh<br>
      Without you, I can't sleep<br>
      Insomnia, don't leave, oh<br>
      Talk to me, without you I can't breathe<br>
      My darkest hours<br>
      Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room<br>
      Different girls on the floor, distracting my thoughts of you<br>
      I turned into the man I used to be, to be<br>
      Put myself to sleep<br>
      Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams<br>
      Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me<br>
      I just wanted to call you and say, and say<br>
      Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?<br>
      I'd give it all just to hold you close<br>
      Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart<br>
      Never comin' down, uh<br>
      I was runnin' away from facin' reality, uh<br>
      Wastin' all of my time on livin' my fantasies<br>
      Spendin' money to compensate, compensate<br>
      'Cause I want you baby<br>
      I'll be livin' in Heaven when I'm inside of you<br>
      It was definitely a blessing wakin' beside you<br>
      I'll never let you down again, again<br>
      Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?<br>
      I'd give it all just to hold you close<br>
      Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart<br>
      I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before<br>
      I'll hold you down and not let you go<br>
      This time I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah<br>
      I know it's all my fault<br>
      Made you put down your guard<br>
      I know I made you fall<br>
      Then said you were wrong for me<br>
      I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (to you)<br>
      Can't hide the truth, I stayed with her in spite of you<br>
      You did some things that you regret, still ride for you<br>
      'Cause this house is not a home<br>
      Without my baby, where are you now when I need you most?<br>
      I gave it all just to hold you close<br>
      Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart<br>
      And I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before<br>
      I'll hold you down and not let you go<br>
      This time I won't break your heart, your heart, no<br></h1></p>

    <p><h1  style="font-family: sans-serif;">You've been my muse for a long time<br>
      You get me through every dark night<br>
      I'm always gone, out on the go<br>
      I'm on the run and you're home alone<br>
      I'm too consumed with my own life<br>
      Are we too young for this?<br>
      Feels like I can't move<br>
      Sharing my heart<br>
      It's tearing me apart<br>
      But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now<br>
      Doing what I can, tryna be a man<br>
      And every time I kiss you, baby<br>
      I can hear the sound of breaking down<br>
      I've been confused as of late (yeah)<br>
      Watching my youth slip away (yeah)<br>
      You're like the sun, you wake me up<br>
      But you drain me out if I get too much<br>
      I might need you or I'll break<br>
      Are we too young for this?<br>
      Feels like I can't move<br>
      Sharing my heart<br>
      It's tearing me apart<br>
      But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now<br>
      Doing what I can, tryna be a man<br>
      And every time I kiss you, baby<br>
      I can hear the sound of breaking down<br>
      Breaking down, breaking down, breaking down<br>
      Breaking down, breaking down, breaking down<br>
      I don't want to play this part<br>
      But I do, all for you<br>
      I don't want to make this hard<br>
      But I will 'cause I'm still<br>
      Sharing my heart<br>
      It's tearing me apart<br>
      But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now (Yeah, I know I would, I know I would)<br>
      Doing what I can, tryna be a man (be your man)<br>
      And every time I kiss you, baby<br>
      I can hear the sound of breaking down<br>
      Sharing my bed, uh<br>
      Sharing my bread,yeah<br>
      Sharing my bed<br>
      Sharing my head<br>
      (I'm breaking down)<br>
      Sharing my heart<br>
      Sharing my, sharing and I'm breaking down<br>
      Sharing, I'm done<br>
      Sharing my life<br></h1></p>

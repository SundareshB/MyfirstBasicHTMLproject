      Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit<br>
      Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon<br>
      Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish<br>
      Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan<br>
      Girls get loose when they hear this song<br>
      100 on the dash get me close to God<br>
      We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars<br>
      House so empty, need a centerpiece<br>
      20 racks a table cut from ebony<br>

      I'll pull you in, I'll pull you back to what you need initially<br>
      It's just one call away<br>
      And you'll leave him, you're loyal to me<br>
      But this time I let you be<br>
      'Cause he seems like he's good for you<br>
      And he makes you feel like you should<br>
      And all your friends say he's the one<br>
      His love for you is true<br>
      But does he know you call me when he sleeps?<br>
      But does he know the pictures that you keep?<br>
      But does he know the reasons that you cry?<br>
      Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?<br>
      Where it truly lies<br>
      Yeah<br>
      You should be with him, I let you go from time<br>
      You should stay with him<br>
      'Cause he seems like he's good for you<br>
      And he makes you feel like you should<br>
      And all your friends say he's the one<br>
      His love for you is true (hey)<br>
      But does he know you call me when he sleeps? (No, no)<br>
      But does he know the pictures that you keep? (Oh)<br>
      But does he know the reasons that you cry?<br>
      Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?<br>
      Where it truly lies<br>
      Right here with me, babe<br>
      Where it truly lies<br>
      My bed, babe<br>
      Where it truly lies<br>
      In my arms, babe<br>
      Where it truly lies<br>
      (Oh-oh-oh)<br>
      Where it truly lies<br>
      Where it truly lies<br>
      (Hey)<br>
      Where it truly lies<br></p></h1>></p>
